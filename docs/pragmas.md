# Pragmas

Pogo accepts instructions using a `#!foo` notation. The following are supported:

## require

* __Description__: Download a package via composer/packagist
* __Signature__: `#!require <yaml-key-value>`
* __Example__: `#!require symfony/yaml: ~3.0`
* __Example__: `#!require {symfony/yaml: ~3.0, symfony/finder: ~3.0}`
* __Comment__: The `<package>` and `<version>` notations match [composer's `require`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require).

## depdir

* __Description__: Specify the location for automatically downloaded packages
* __Signature__: `#!depdir <yaml-string>`
* __Example__: `#!depdir '/tmp'
* __Example__: `#!depdir '../var/cache'
* __Comment__: If the path is relative, it is interpreted as relative to the script file. (This differs from the CLI option `--dl` which defaults to the PWD.)
    The path may use the following variables:
    * Environment:
        * `{POGO_BASE}`: This is either env-var POGO_BASE or fallback (such as `$HOME/.cache/pogo` or `/tmp/pogo`)
        * `{PHP_X}`: PHP version (MAJOR part)
        * `{PHP_XY}`:PHP version (MAJOR.MINOR parts)
        * `{PHP_XYZ}`:PHP version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH parts)
        * `{ENV[...]}`: Reference any environment variable
    * Script location
        * `{SCRIPT_DIR}`: The folder containing the main script
        * `{SCRIPT_FILE}`: The filename of the main script
        * `{SCRIPT_NAME}`: The filename of the main script, but with file-extensions removed
        * `_SCRIPTDIR_` (*deprecated*): The folder containing the main script
    * Script content
        * `{CODE_DIGEST}`: A checksum based on the raw code of the script
        * `{REQUIRE_DIGEST}`: A checksum based on the `#!require` directives of the script
        * `{SCRIPT_DIGEST}`: A checksum based on the content and location of the script

## ini

* __Description__: Set the value of `php.ini` option *before* launching the script.
* __Signature__: `#!ini <yaml-key-value>`
* __Example__: `#!ini variables_order: EGPS`
* __Example__: `#!ini {max_upload_size: 1m, memory_limit: 1g}`

## ttl

* __Description__: The time-to-live determines the maximum time to retain previously downloaded dependencies.
    * The `<qty> <unit>` notation is a strict subset of [PHP `strtotime()`](php.net/strtotime).
    * The `<unit>` can be `sec`, `min`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`.
* __Signature__: `#!ttl <qty> <unit>`
* __Example__: `#!ttl 7 days`
* __Comment__: Any change in dependencies will trigger a new download -- regardless of `ttl`. So what is `ttl` for?
  It allows scripts to remain reasonably secure (up-to-date) by default.  If you don't want this, you can always peg versions more precisely (`~3.0` vs `3.4.20`) or a set a long a `ttl` (`10 years`).

## run

* __Description__: After `pogo` updates the dependencies, it needs to call `php` and execute your script. Unfortunately, I have not found
  a great, one-size-fits-all technique for this delegation. The defaults should *execute correctly* in most scripting scenarios - but
  support for *nice backtraces* might be compromised if you use a `#!/usr/bin/env pogo...` header. In that case, you might want to
  try a different mode.
* __Signature__: `#!run <yaml-string|yaml-key-value>`
* __Example__: `#!run local`
* __Example__: `#!run {with: prepend, extraStuff: true}`
* __Options__:
    * Abstract runners: Use these to indicate loosely *what you want* without committing to a specific *implementation*
        * `auto`: Let `pogo` pick a mechanism.
        * `isolate`: Let `pogo` pick a mechanism, as long as the mechanism is guaranteed to launch in an isolated sub-process.
          (Current implementation: use `prepend`)
        * `local`: Let `pogo` pick a mechanism, as long as the mechanism is guaranteed to launch in the same PHP process as pogo.
          (Current implementation: check for `#!` line, then pick either `require` or `eval`)
    * Concrete runners:
        * `prepend` (isolate): Loosely, this runs `php -d auto_prepend_file=$autoloader $your_script`.
        * `require` (local): Loosely, this runs `require "$your_script";`. This provides better backtraces and debugging because
          it references the original PHP file on disk; however, if the file has a `#!` on the first line, it'll erroneously display it.
        * `eval` (local): Loosely, this runs `eval(cleanup($your_script));`. This may not work as nicely for debugging, but it won't
          display the extraneous `#!`.

# YAML (Subset)

Most pragmas accept either strings or key-value pairs, e.g.

```php
#!foo somestring
#!bar {key1: value1, key2: value2}
```

To simplify implementation, `pogo` uses a YAML library to parse these. YAML is the most forgiving
of the widely-known formats, so it's reasonably easy to read+write.

In this context, we don't use the full YAML. There are no new-lines, multi-line content, indentation, 
anchors, or aliases.

Consequently, you should regard these inputs as a subset of YAML -- or, perhaps more precisely, consider
the inputs as JSON without the mandatory double-quotes. If the parsing library ever needs to be changed,
it will be checked against this subset - but may not be required to have full YAML compliance.
